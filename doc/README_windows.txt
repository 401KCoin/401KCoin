401K Coin Core
=====================

Intro
-----
401K Coin (401K) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after 
Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s vision for Bitcoin. It is a decentralized, 
peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed 
by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies. 
Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by 
high-powered mining hardware. 401K Coin utilizes an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm, 
can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment. 
The Green Protocol offers a simple solution to Bitcoin sustainability issues and provides a faster, 
more scalable blockchain that is better suited for daily transactional use.
